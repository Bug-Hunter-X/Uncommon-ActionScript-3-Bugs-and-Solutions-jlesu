The following ActionScript 3 code attempts to access a property of a null object, resulting in a runtime error:

```actionscript
var myObject:Object = null;
trace(myObject.someProperty);
```

This is a common error, but can be subtle due to the dynamic nature of ActionScript.  The `myObject` variable might unexpectedly be null due to a previous operation failing or not initializing correctly.  Additionally, incorrect assumptions about data types or object lifecycles can contribute to this problem.

Another example involves accessing an array index that is out of bounds:

```actionscript
var myArray:Array = ["one", "two"];
trace(myArray[2]);
```

This will also cause an error.  This can be easily missed when working with dynamic arrays where the size is not explicitly checked.

Event listeners that are not properly removed can cause memory leaks.  If an object is destroyed but its event listener remains attached to a still-live object, this can lead to unpredictable behavior and is an uncommon but significant error.
